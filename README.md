# realestateagents

We're looking for some help on the data mining front. The website below lists a number of realtors across the US and we're looking to compile into a spreadsheet.

The deliverable should be an Excel file with the following columns:

Column 1: Name
Column 2: City
Column 3: State
Column 4: Email

We'd like for you to spend 30 hours, at most, compiling.

Here is the website:
